## How to Use

  Edit `data/products.json` to add, remove, or update products, prices, discounts, colors, and availability.

- **Site Structure:**  
  - `index.html` – Home page
  - `footwears.html` – All footwears (filterable)
  - `essentials.html` – All accessories (filterable)
  - `about.html` – About Prestige Pedicraft
  - `assets/css/styles.css` – All styles
  - `assets/js/main.js` – All scripts
  - `assets/images/` – Logos and product images (replace placeholders with your real images)

- **How to Replace Placeholder Images:**  
  Simply upload your real image (for example, your logo) to `assets/images/`, using the same filename (e.g., `logo.png`).  
  Example:  
  1. Prepare your logo as `logo.png`  
  2. Upload it to `assets/images/` in your repo, replacing the placeholder.
